# 🧠 Vectorizing a Node.js Project and Storing in Vectra

Follow the steps below to extract valuable content from your current Node.js project, vectorize it, and store it into the Vectra vector database for AI-powered search and Q&A.

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Initialize the Vector Index

Run the following command in your project root directory to initialize the vector index using the MCP tool:

```bash
ask-your-lib-initialize
```

This will create the vector index structure to support future insertions.

## 📄 Step 2: Extract Core Project Content

Traverse the entire project and extract the following key content for vectorization:

### ✅ Project Overview

- Project background and objectives  
- Installation, configuration, and usage instructions  
- Key features and functionality  
- Technology stack and dependency list  
- Author, contributors, and community support info

(Recommended to extract from `README.md`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc.)

### ✅ Source Code Insights (`.js` / `.ts` files)

- Functional descriptions and structural logic of each module  
- Core functions, classes, interfaces with comments  
- Meaningful inline comments or JSDoc annotations  

Ensure the extracted content retains **contextual completeness** for semantic use.

### ✅ Additional Documentation (Markdown, config files, etc.)

- Development guides, API documentation, FAQs  
- Descriptive fields from `package.json` (e.g., `description`, `scripts`, `dependencies`)

> 💡 **Tip**: Use glob patterns to collect `.ts`, `.js`, `.md`, `.json` files and apply smart filtering.

Organize the results into an array of strings, with each segment treated as a single vector unit.

## 🧬 Step 3: Vectorize and Insert into Database

Use the following command to vectorize and insert each extracted text segment:

```bash
ask-your-lib-insert --text "xxx"
```

Make sure that:

- Each segment is successfully vectorized  
- Add metadata like filenames or module names if possible  
- Inserted data is ordered to preserve semantic continuity

## ⚠️ Notes

- Avoid vectorizing trivial, empty, or duplicate content  
- For long documents, consider chunking the text  
- Maintain the original structure and semantics for better retrieval
